Initial Design Document Critique
Jake Meyer

I believe the general idea I wrote in my initial design document for this project was very helpful in the construction of the code. 
But, there were a few additions and adjustments I had to make to make the program effective.

I did end up searching each and every pixel of the image to get the RGB values using a 2D array, and then changing the RGB values 
that matched the user's old color to entry to the RGB values of the user's new color entry.  But instead of using the 255 scale, I 
used hex values to store each color as a single int.

I included most of the exceptions I laid out in the initial design document.  I returned an error message if the user tried to enter 
an invalid file type for either the old image file or the new image file.  I returned an error if the file could not be found.

I also added a few if statements to include any errors the user may make that wouldn't decode the message successfully.  If the user 
typed in inaccessible colors, I returned an error message.  If the old color and the new color were equal to each other, I returned 
a message to tell the user that the message wouldn't be decoded if we simply changed the old color to the same color it already was.
